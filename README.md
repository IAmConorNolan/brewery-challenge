## About This Challenge

Thank you for taking the time to issue this challenge to me, and taking the time to have a look at this project.

I was not able to complete section 1 in the time provided, and so my attempts are ommited as they did not work. I was not able to come up with a suitable algorithim that would correctly find the answer beyond brute force by generating all possible combinations, which is obviously an imperfect, slow solution.

I noticed that the problem poses is similar to the Lazy Bartender problem which is NP Hard, and an algorithim that solves this problem is also likely NP hard.

There is however, likely a greedy algorithim solution that produces a "good guess" in less time - by satisfying the largest number of customers possible with each pass, however I was unable to come up with a solution.
